mkdir makes a new directory.

cd changes the current working directory.

git status

Git Staging Environment
One of the core functions of Git is the concepts of the Staging Environment, and the Commit.
As you are working, you may be adding, editing and removing files. But whenever you hit a milestone or finish a part of the work, you should add the files to a Staging Environment.

Staged files are files that are ready to be committed to the repository you are working on. You will learn more about commit shortly.

For now, we are done working with index.html. So we can add it to the Staging Environment:

git add demo.txt
